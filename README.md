## Running the Notebook:

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install all necessary python libraries to run the notebooks for analysis. Not necessary if you are running through a Jupyter Notebook. 
2. Configure your python environment. You may use a `Conda` environment or select a preset kernel. I personally used the 3.11.4 global env kernel. Another option is to download the files individually and run the cells directly in a Jupyter notebook. 

## Troubleshooting:

1. A common issue is that the imports will not immediately work directly after installing all required libraries if using an IDE. This is easily fixed by restarting your kernel (or IDE in the worst case) or setting up a `Conda` environment and running `conda install --file requirements.txt -c conda-forge` to install dependencies.
